## Timewarrior indicator gnome-shell extensions

A very simple indicator for the gnome-shell that displays the current activity tracked from [timewarrior](https://timewarrior.net/)

## Prerequisites

Timewarrior :) You can get it from here: https://timewarrior.net/

## Project overview

This is a very simple gnome-shell extension that parses the output of the __timew__ binary and returns the current activity and the duration of it. The current activity is derived from all the tags that are returned from the __timew__ command. The longest tag is used. The string is cut to be max 20 char long.

The duration is also derived from the output of the __timew__ command and is displayed in a _HH:MM_ format.

## Installation

The extension can be installed directly from source,
either for the convenience of using git or to test the latest version.

Clone the latest version with git

    git clone https://github.com/tassos/timewarrior-indicator.git \
    ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/timewarrior-indicator@natsakis.com

A Shell reload is required <code>Alt+F2 r Enter</code> and extension
has to be enabled with *gnome-tweak-tool*

## Upcoming features

Some ideas for extra features:

- ~~Create a settings panel~~ (implemented in 38625363c7c357a69418896f5ff35377abe62ef6)
- ~~Restart previous activities from the panel~~ (implemented in 38625363c7c357a69418896f5ff35377abe62ef6)
- Change the display format
- Change the tag to display
